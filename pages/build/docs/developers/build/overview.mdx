# Build with Rhonix

There are multiple ways to build, test and deploy rholang code. Rholang code can be used with a vscode extension and docker, use the codesandbox or run it locally on a node.

The easiest way to get startet, is to follow this [tutorial](/build/docs/developers/libraries/use-docker/) under the rhonix sdk. This one uses the vscode extension together with a local docker instance of rnode.
