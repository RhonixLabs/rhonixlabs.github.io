# Use VSCode

The evaluation of rholang code is done on a rnode client. This tutorial explains how to setup everything to run rholang code in VSCode with the use of a rholang [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode)

## Install the rholang extension in VSCode

The VSCode extension runs with Windows, Linux, Mac. This tutorial describes the installing process for windows.

**Prerequisites:**
Windows 10

1. Install the latest updates for windows 10 and install the latest version of [docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). Click on **Get Docker** and install it on your pc. Restart the pc.
2. After restart run the Docker Desktop application.
3. There has to be a **white** docker logo on the windows taskbar.
   If the docker logo ist red, then there is a docker problem with your pc (sometimes wsl_update_x64.msi has to be additionally installed).

7. Create a new file with the .rho extension. And write some rholang code:

   ```ts
   new helloworld, stdout(`rho:io:stdout`) in {
   contract helloworld( world ) = {
      for( @msg <- world )
      { stdout!(msg) }
   }

   | new world, world2 in {
         helloworld!(*world)
      | world!("Hello World")
      | helloworld!(*world2)
      | world2!("Hello World again")
      }
   }
   ```

8. Save the hello.rho file with strg+s. After every save the rholang file is evaluated on the rnode instance in docker.

9. Open a terminal in VSCode, go to OUTPUT and select Rholang in the navbar. The evaluated result of the code in this example is: "Hello World again"
   "Hello World".

   > ⚠️ If you get the following errors in your console:  
   > _docker: Error response from daemon: open \\.\pipe\docker_engine_linux_ or  
   > _docker: Error response from daemon: status code not OK but 500:_ then wait and restart vscode again.
