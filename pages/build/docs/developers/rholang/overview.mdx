# Rholang

Rholang is a new programming language designed for use in distributed systems. This document describes the syntax in Rholang.

Rholang is "process-oriented": all computation is done by means of message passing. Messages are passed on "channels", which are rather like message queues; however, the channels behave more like bags (multisets) rather than queues, since there is no implicit ordering on messages.

Rholang is completely asynchronous, in the sense that while you can read a message from a channel and then do something with it, you can't send a message and then do something once it has been received, at least, not without explicitly waiting for an acknowledgment message from the receiver. Every channel has a name, and every name denotes a unique channel.
