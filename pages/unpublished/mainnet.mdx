Rhonix Mainnet is live. Initially, it will run all the nodes in the root shard but expects that to change in the future.

Rhonix uses a pure proof-of-stake version of the correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper consensus framework.

Parameters for Rhonix Root Shard Nodes

- The root shard is limited to 100 validator nodes and unlimited read-only nodes.
- After the root shard, 100 validator slots are filled, bonding requests will be queued in a waiting list. Validators are randomly selected from the waiting list for bonding.
- Approved bonding requests get up to two weeks to provision hardware before they are placed in rotation.
- Unbonded validators may re-apply for validation. Their bonding will be treated just like any other bonding request and may be subject to queuing on the waiting list.
- The minimum bonding period for all validator nodes is four months.
- The deposit will be bounded for the entire time they are resident in the validator set unless the validatorâ€™s deposit is subject to slashing.
- When a validator requests to unbond to leave the validator set, the validator must wait a minimum of two weeks for their bond to be returned.
- Bonding minimum is 10,000 REV and maximum is 5,000,000 REV.
