# Rhonix's Vision

## Introduction

Users don't own their own data on the current version of the internet (Web 2). All the data generated by users of the big platforms sit within centralised silos. Not only do these data farms choke the environment, but a military strike can take them down, along with our data. Decentralization is therefore inevitable in this unstable geo-political environment because it means a robust and safe network for our data.

Further, these centralised data silos have created immense structural market asymmetries in industries where data drives decision making in finance, insurance, medicine, engineering, news and media publishing and education. These asymmetries in fact stifle innovation rather than promote it. They increase financial risks rather than de-leverage them.

Disinformation campaigns and 'fake news' have led to democratic subversion and incitement to violence. It's also led to record low confidence in the media and the institutions and events upon which they report on.

Big Tech platforms have largely monopolised user data for the benefit of their true customers, who purchase their data for advertising or other purposes. They've also created barriers which prevent people from seeking better ownership of their data and seeking the best available data with which to make decisions.

Big Tech has in fact become so powerful that it has the capacity to modify user behaviour. It can lead, especially our young people, to unknowingly make decisions against their own best interests, and there is little doubt it contributes to their mental health problems.

In the Web 2 paradigm, data of benefit in any trade or transaction may be amplified. Whereas, data causing liability may be deliberately lost or ignored.

It has simply become too difficult to interact with trust and confidence in the marketplace of information. Both governments and the market are ready for a transformational move away from Big Tech.

We want our children (and future generations) to own their digital footprint, which is worth more than you can fathom to Big Tech. At Rhonix, we believe if people owned their own data, we could help re-distribute the ubiquitous power of Big Tech.

## Rhonix: Making Web 3 a Reality for Real Users

We registered the company, Rhonix Labs FZE, in the DWTC Free Zone in Dubai. Dubai is leading the pack in the public blockchain space. It's the first country in the world to introduce a regulatory regime around virtual assets under the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, [https://www.vara.ae/en/](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/AqABC0YK9PiKx4o9ILUSq3?domain=eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com), with Henson Orser recently being appointed as CEO of VARA. VARA is also based in the DWTC Free Zone.

Blockchain technology is applicable in areas where there is a lack of trust between parties involved or responsibility boundaries, since on-chain transparency and intrinsic consensus mechanism provide traceability and proofs for agreements. All on-chain activity on Rhonix is public and recorded.

Rhonix is not primarily a financial network, it is a data first network to improve the plumbing of cyberspace. Buying the Rhonix token is buying a subscription to be able to read and write to a network of knowledge that aids innovation and risk management.

Risk management has been identified by both the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the National Society of Professional Engineers in the United States of America as the best and highest use case for block chain technology.

Value comes from real world utility and insurable engineered solutions, not numbers on a computer. Insurance, and especially the insurance of engineering and metropolitan infrastructure, not finance, is the highest use case for block chain technology. Rhonix aims to become a tool for insurers and engineers before financiers. This is the best way to build a strong floor price and shield our network from malpractice, malfeasance and the general immaturity of the broader industry at this time.

## Common adoption of Web 3

Common adoption of a smart contracting Web 3 platform like Rhonix means applications being hammered by hundreds of millions of active concurrent users on a 24/7 basis.

The programming model that provides support for this scale is going to allow developers who use it to out compete developers who are using a programming model that can't. Rhonix runs as many transactions concurrently as possible. It can detect when two transactions step on each other's toes and can sequentialize these. It runs everything else concurrently.

We move away from the paradigm of total ordering of blocks because that makes execution sequential. Instead, we first make execution concurrent and then match the consensus algorithm to enable concurrent execution. Rhonix therefore makes concurrent state transitions to enable execution scalability. This is a unique feature not shared by our competitors.

Fundamental adoption is not just about the throughput. It's about correctness and security. If you're moving too fast with incorrect code, you're going to bring down the network. The next generation of platforms are getting close to Visa-level speeds, but they don't have this next level of security and logical correctness.

Unless you have this next level of logical correctness and security, you will constantly be running into safety flaws, and other kinds of financial risks. This is and will remain the fundamental barrier to common adoption.

The base layer (our Layer 1 protocol) of blockchain will be the most significant 'component part' of Web3.

As you may know, the base layer of blockchain is not Web3. Neither are all the cryptocurrencies and tokens. Here's a simple way to think about it:

- The base layer: blockchain (Rhonix)
- The value layer: cryptocurrency/tokens
- The application layer: decentralised applications
- The governance layer: DAO's (decentralized autonomous organizations)
- The "keys" to your cryptocurrency/tokens: self-custodial wallets
- The identity layer: verifiable credentials to provide self-sovereign identity in Web3

If you combine all of these, you essentially get Web 3.

## A deep dive into the tech; RhoVM: The Best in Class Virtual Machine

Existing layer 1 chains get slower as hardware (nodes) are added to the network. A node is a device (usually a computer) that participates in the block chain network to validate transactions.

While other platforms run slower as more hardware is added, Rhonix's highly concurrent execution runs faster as more hardware is added.

If other layer 1 chains get slower as hardware/nodes are added, it's not feasible to store important data assets directly on chain. Basically, the tech behind Rhonix's software uses all the hardware, turning the hardware computing capacity into software performance.

A foundation of Process Calculus for stable asynchronous concurrency is key to ensuring that a smart contracting platform can scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second and upwards.

Rhonix' technology is expressly founded in the 'Rho-Calculus', whereby process calculus

is encoded directly within the smart contract language itself: Rholang. The state of the chain at any one time for any node resolves down to a predictable and safe Rholang expression in 'R-Space'.

Rholang is expressly designed to encode distributed applications. Rholang doesn't use 'variables', rather everything in Rholang is a 'process' being sent or a 'name' being received on a specified channel. Turing Completeness emerges from the possible interactions of these processes, names and channels.

The channel in Rholang is the explicit representation of parallel communication within the Rhonix network, or 'concurrency'. Channels can be open and closed independently of one another, while Rholang distributed applications are capable of expressing Turing Completeness with the inherent properties necessary to express the resulting infinite complexity at an infinite possible scale.

Rhonix technology was the first adopter of the Casper Consensus, but with the intention

for Leaderless block creation with additional capability for State Optimization. Rhonix' Web 3 solution is both Composable and Scale-able.

Node resolution in R-Space allows for leaderless block creation within a Proof of Stake Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), unlike any other solution. Consistently with GDPR requirements, nodes can sync to the network faster by knowing only the 'Last Finalised State' of the chain.

### Organisational Background

We're not a research project. Our tech has been in development since 2016. Our old network was a layer 1 blockchain used in a production main-net for 2+ years but it was sequential, so it was never going to scale upon common adoption.

The next iteration of our open-source technology will introduce a tree-like structure allowing leaderless generation of multiple blocks all at the same time; unlocking potentially infinite scale.

Our tech has been built from the ground-up with scaling and security front of mind so we're not hamstrung by a Layer 2 roll-up centric design (like Ethereum) that is likely to introduce security flaws and bottlenecks when common adoption means billions of transactions hammering a public blockchain per day.

Our aim is to support decentralization, on chain data storage, security, economics, and the scaling needs of Web3, while being one of the most energy efficient chains on the market.

Rhonix can provide safe formally verifiable cooperation among on-chain smart contracts in a concurrent and sharded setting. This is the foundation to forming Rhonix's world computer with real network effect for a real Web 3.0.

Our ambition is to launch a next generation **Layer 1** public blockchain platform with a data-centric design that aims to achieve Visa-like speed, security, and the ability to support decentralization, on chain data, security, economics, and the scaling needs of Web 3.0.

An established and passionate global community of talented developers, system and network support, and technology write-up contributors who remain invested in the technology are all ready to go under a new governance and management structure. Rhonix is renewing efforts to bring this technology to market, learning from past errors and benefiting from the significant and ground-breaking progress made to date

### Object Capabilities: Privacy and Permissioning at Scale

In order to scale distributed applications, not only must the core functionality scale, but the permissions within the distributed applications must also scale for Web 3 to meaningfully disrupt existing enterprise applications.

Rholang can express 'Object Capabilities' or the ability to turn a permission into its own programmable object. Current databases and competing solutions such a SQL, Ethereum and Bitcoin only allow for legacy UNIX permissions, which not only limit complexity, but also create a high burden for ongoing operational cybersecurity management.

Rhonix' RhoVM allows for object capability expression. This means:

1. Infinite unbounded scaling
2. Infinite unbounded expression of Turing Completeness in production
3. Infinite unbounded expression of security and privacy in distributed applications

Gaming and music to build further community and transaction volume

In the short term, one of our first MVP's is to build a Godot Software Development Kit (SDK) to attract the Godot gaming community to use our network. Ariel Manzur, one of the founders of the open-source multi-platform 2D and 3D gaming engine Godot is on our Advisory Board.

We also intend to demonstrate our ability to store songs directly on chain, and the vast potential this creates for those who create them. Essentially, it undermines the role of the bully and the thief in the form of Spotify. Rholang is also a sophisticated query language which means, by way of example, that a DJ has the capacity to search for all songs in a particular genre at a tempo of 120 beats per minute.

In the medium to long term future, we aim to expand vertical targets to enterprise clients, including:

- Social Media
- Entertainment
- Sports
- Government
- Finance
- Engineering and Infrastructure
- Transport
- Logistics
- Employment/Recruitment

## Developer Experience

When developers build on our platform, we believe they'll never leave because of our superior performance, security, low transaction costs and energy efficiency. The Rholang programming language is safe by construction. This means that writing smart contracts has a drastically lower quality assurance burden to ensure the code is safe out in the wild. Ethereum's QA burden with the Solidity programming language is 40 hours per line of code in production. On average, for Rhonix, the burden is 4 minutes. The code is safer and cheaper to write. Smart contract code can be written in other languages on our network too. On Rhonix, smart contract code can be written in languages like C Sharp or JavaScript (and shortly in Rust) by a single developer or in a pair, as opposed to requiring vast teams and many months. Rhonix will bring full customisation of smart contracts in global production into the hands of even a garage band start up.
