# Turborepo Quickstart

Turborepo is an intelligent 2 **build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases**.

Your codebase's tasks - like `lint`, `build` and `test` - **don't run as fast as they could**. Turborepo uses [caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching) to turbocharge your local setup and speed up your CI.

Turborepo is designed to be **incrementally adopted**, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

## Examples

You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. For even more examples and starters, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples).
