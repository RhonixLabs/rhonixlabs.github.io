# Wallets on the Rhonix network

With this tutorial you learn to create a wallet and transfer testnet or mainnet tokens.

## Create a wallet

1. To use the rhonix network you need to have a wallet. Open this [rnode-client](https://tgrospic.github.io/rnode-client-js/) page from the rhonix community. There you can create a new wallet. The code to this wallet is [open-source](https://github.com/tgrospic/rnode-client-js).

2. Change the network to testnet. The testnet is for testing puposes only.

    > ⚠️ Save your private key, public key, ETH key, REV key somewhere else!

    > ⚠️ Never share your private key with somebody else!

    > ⚠️ The REV key is like an ethereum address you can share.
